    <h1>The Theremin: The World's First Electronic Instrument</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>An Instrument for the Atomic Era</h2>
    <p>   From Wikipedia: "The theremin originally known as the Ã¦therphone/etherphone, thereminophone 
        or termenvox is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the 
        performer (who is known as a thereminist). It is named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, 
        who patented the device in 1928.</p>

    <p> The instrument's controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas which sense the 
        relative position of the thereminist's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, 
        and amplitude (volume) with the other. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified 
        and sent to a loudspeaker.</p>

    <p> The theremin was the product of Soviet government-sponsored research into proximity sensors. 
        The instrument was invented in October 1919 by the Russian physicist Lev Sergeyevich Termen, 
        known in the West as Leon Theremin. After a lengthy tour of Europe, during which time he demonstrated his invention to packed houses, Theremin moved to the United States, where he patented his invention in 1928.
         Subsequently, Theremin granted commercial production rights to RCA."</p>
